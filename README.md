# bunnyAAT v0.0.2b

0) PREFACE

  I know it is strange that this repo starts with v0.0.2b. Well, the earlier versions can be found in the link by desciption. And if you read Chinese you'll know more details about this project, which is really not necessary since the best part (so far) is posted here at github.
  
1) HARDWARE SETUP

  In "hardware" folder you can find autocad blueprints (.dwg) in "frame" and schematic diagrames in "scheme".
  Read the schematic diagrams and you will know what boards and sensors to buy.
  "3mm.dwg" illustrates additional parts I need to complete the structure of the antenna tracker plus the payload adapter for blacksheep  quadcopter airframe, which is shown in "blacksheep.dwg".
  "adapter.dwg" is only useful if you want to use the giant 23dbi MFD antenna and it is recommended to do so because the size of bunnyAAT fits so well with this large antenna.
  "base.dwg" shows you what bunnyAAT looks like. Most of its parts are bought online. One possible version of the base can be found in the link below:
